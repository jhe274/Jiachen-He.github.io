👨‍💻 I’m a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Physics at the University of Kentucky, specializing in **lasers, optics, and magnetic field design**.

🔬 My research focuses on advanced **optical and magnetic systems**, with an emphasis on the **magneto-optic effect**, data acquisition, analysis, and the development of high-precision instrumentation.

🎓 Currently, I am working towards completing my Ph.D. dissertation, where I am developing a **sensitive optical magnetometer utilizing the resonant Faraday effect**. Additionally, I have created Python-based systems for **synchronous data acquisition** and designed a **Merritt coil system** for **active magnetic field cancellation**.

🎯 I am passionate about leveraging **Python** and other software tools to enhance scientific workflows and improve the accuracy of experimental results.

### 🌀 **Polarization Modulation Ellipsometry**
I am an expert in **birefringence measurement systems**, with particular emphasis on system setup, calibration, and optimization. Using lock-in amplifiers, Muller calculus, and waveform analysis, I have achieved **sub-μrad accuracy** in measuring sensitive optical signals.

### 🧲 **Magnetic Field Design**
- Designed and developed a **Merritt coil system** for generating uniform magnetic fields, utilizing Python and finite element analysis (COMSOL).
- Collaborated closely with machine shop teams to build and test the system, which plays a critical role in my research on **active magnetic field cancellation**.

### 🔦 **Laser Frequency Stabilization**
I have extensive experience in **laser frequency stabilization**, employing advanced techniques such as **Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH)** locking and **Doppler-free saturated absorption spectroscopy (DSAS)** in complex optical systems to achieve precise frequency control.

### 🖥️ **Professional Experience**
As a **Graduate Research Assistant** at the University of Kentucky, I have led and contributed to numerous research projects focused on **optical alignment, polarization modulation, and magnetic field optimization**. I have worked closely with cross-functional teams to design and implement custom experimental setups using state-of-the-art optical and laser technologies.
