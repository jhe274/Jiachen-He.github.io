### 🔧 **Scientific Software Development**
Strong background in object-orientated programming, personally developed and maintained several Python packages that contribute to scientific research, including:
- **Faraday_DA**: A tool for analyzing rotation measurements with a focus on script automation, supporting Faraday rotation measurements.
- **Faraday_DAQ**: A modular system that facilitates seamless communication between scientific instruments, such as wavelengthmeter, Gaussmeter, laser controller, and lock-in amplifiers using Python.

You can explore all my software contributions on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jhe274), where I promote transparency and collaboration in scientific research.

### ⚛️🧭 **Quantum Sensing**
Expert in **polarization modulation ellipsomtry**, with particular emphasis on system setup, calibration, and optimization. Developed a system for detecting minute magnetic field variations associated with spin-polarized helium-3 targets using nonlinear magneto-optic effects without magnetic shielding, estimating a shot noise limited sensitivity of $4.8\times10^{-11}\,\text{G}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ under spin-exchange optical pumping operating temperautre ($\sim510\ \text{K}$).

### 🔦 **Laser Frequency Stabilization**
Extensive experience in **laser locking**, employing advanced techniques such as **Pound-Drever-Hall** locking and **Doppler-free saturated absorption spectroscopy**, integrating complex optical systems and electro-optical devices to achieve high-precision frequency control.

### 🧲 **Magnetic Field Design**
- Designed and developed a **Merritt coil system** for generating uniform magnetic fields, utilizing Python and finite element analysis (COMSOL).
- Collaborated closely with machine shop teams to build and test the system, which plays a critical role in my research on **active magnetic field cancellation**.

### 🧊 **Cryogenic and Vacuum Systems**
Contributed to system calibration and maintenance of a cryogenic system, gaining hands-on experience with vacuum technologies over five years.

### 🖥️ **Professional Experience**
As a **Graduate Research Assistant** at the University of Kentucky, I have led and contributed to numerous research projects focused on **precision metrology, polarization modulation, and magnetic field optimization**. I have worked closely with cross-functional teams to design and implement custom experimental setups using state-of-the-art optical and laser technologies.

### 🧑‍🏫 **Collaboration & Leadership**
I am passionate about fostering the next generation of scientists and engineers through mentorship and collaboration:

- **Undergraduate Mentorship**: Supervised multiple undergraduate students during the **Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program**, including one from **MIT**, providing theoretical guidance on **the resonant Faraday effect in a two-level system**. This work culminated in a **presentation at the 2024 Division of Nuclear Physics (DNP) Meeting**.
- **High School Mentorship**: Guided a high school student through a scientific project to explore **the polarization of light** and measure the **speed of light** using cavity mirrors and a rotating mirror.
- **Community Engagement**: Previously served as the **representative of the Physics Department in the University of Kentucky Graduate Student Congress (GSC)** and was appointed as the **Department of Physics & Astronomy Alumni Liaison**, a role in which I am honored to serve.
