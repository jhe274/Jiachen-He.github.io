Education
======
* Ph.D. in Physics, University of Kentucky, (Expected Graduation: May 2025)
* M.S. in Physics, University of Kentucky, 2019
* B.E. in Measurement Control Technology and Instruments, Shenzhen University, 2017

Professional Experience
======
* **Graduate Research Assistant**  
  University of Kentucky, August 2019 - Present  
  - **Software Development**: Strong background in scientific programming, developed Python package for the wavelength meter, facilitating efficient communication and buffer usage without relying on low-level SCPI commands.

  - **Data Analysis**: Created and implemented multiple Python scripts for comprehensive Faraday rotation data analysis. All scripts and packages are available on GitHub to promote transparency and collaboration in scientific research.

  - **Synchronous Data Acquisition (SDAQ)**: Proficient in developing modular Python-based SDAQ systems for communication with scientific instruments such as digital I/O interfaces, wavelength meters, laser controllers, lock-in amplifiers, and Gaussmeters. The system efficiently initializes, configures, and synchronizes instruments, sending TTL-level pulse trigger signals and recording data in their buffers.
    
  - **Polarization Modulation Ellipsometry**: Expert in birefringence measurement system, including calibration and optimization. Performed precise optical alignment, utilizing lock-in amplifiers, Muller calculus, and waveform analysis to achieve sub-$\mu$rad accuracy in sensitive optical signal measurements.
    
  - **Merritt Coil Development and Implementation**: Designed and simulated (using Python) a Merritt coil system, followed by Autodesk Inventor modeling to incorporate mechanical engineering tasks for its development and construction. Collaborated closely with machine shop teams to ensure successful project delivery.
    
  - **Magnetic Field Design**: Independently developed a magnet box prototype, applying finite element analysis (COMSOL) to create uniform magnetic fields with shielding. This early-career project deepened my experience with FEA software and involved leveraging concepts like magnetic scalar potential and image fields.

  - **Laser Frequency Stabilization**: Extensive experience in spectroscopic laser frequency stabilization using PDH and DSAS techniques with alkali metals (Rb, K).

  - **Cryogenic and Vacuum Systems**: Contributed to system calibration and maintenance of a cryogenic system, gaining hands-on experience with vacuum technologies over five years.

  - **Ongoing Projects**: Machine learning algorithms for real-time magnetic field cancellation, software development for scientific instruments and implementing side-band laser locking using EOM.
  
* **Graduate Teaching Assistant**  
  University of Kentucky, August 2017 - May 2019  
  - Instructed undergraduate students in Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, and physical optics through hands-on lab sessions and interactive recitations, fostering a deeper understanding of core physics concepts.
  - Assisted in preparing teaching materials, grading, and answering student inquiries during lab sessions.

* **Summer Research Assistant**  
  University of Kentucky, May 2018 - August 2018  
  - Conducted research on Etch Track-Directed Growth of Carbon Nanotubes on Graphite.
  - Utilized chemical vapor deposition techniques to create graphene/boron nitride samples.
  - Studied frictional properties on the surface of graphene using a microfluidic probe.
  
* **Grduation Project**
  Shenzhen University, September 2015 - May 2016
  - Research on the Control System of Intelligent Fish Tank Based on Single Chip Microcomputer

* **Open Laboratory Fund Project**
  Shenzhen University, September 2012 - October 2013
  - Research on the Design of Temperature-controlled Automatic Watering Device
