Professional Experience
======
* **Graduate Research Assistant**  
  University of Kentucky, August 2019 - Present  

  - **Quantum Sensing**: Expert in polarization modulation ellipsometry, specializing in precise optical alignment, system calibration, and optimization. Developed a system for detecting minute magnetic field variations associated with spin-polarized helium-3 targets using nonlinear magneto-optic effects without magnetic shielding, estimating a shot noise limited sensitivity of $4.8\times10^{-11}\ \text{G}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ under spin-exchange optical pumping operating temperautre ($\sim510\ \text{K}$).

  - **Laser Frequency Stabilization**: Extensive experience in spectroscopic laser locking using PDH and DSAS techniques with cavities and alkali metals (Rb, K), reducing laser frequency drift to $200\ \text{kHz}/\text{h}$ -- over $110$ times more stable than unlocked systems. Implemented sideband locking over $24\ \text{GHz}$ using a $6\ \text{GHz}$ bandwidth EOM for precise frequency control.

  - **Software Development**: Published two Python packages on [GitHub](https://github.com/jhe274/Faraday_DAQ) using object-orientated programming to interface with scientific instruments like wavelength meter and Gaussmeter, eliminating reliance on low-level SCPI commands while optimizing buffer management and communication protocols.

  - **Lab Automation**: Proficient in developing modular Python-based synchronous data acquisition systems for communication with scientific instruments such as wavelength meter, laser controller, lock-in amplifiers, and Gaussmeter. The system efficiently initializes, configures, and synchronizes instruments, sending TTL-level pulse trigger signals and recording data in their buffers with sub-millisecond time differences.
    
  - **Merritt Coil Development and Implementation**: Designed and simulated a compact Merritt coil system to replace Helmholtz coils, reducing the size by 6x while reducing the longitudianl field gradient by a factor of 4 and increasing the uniform field range by 33%. Utilized Python and Autodesk Inventor, collaborating closely with machine shop teams to ensure successful implementation.

  - **Compact Magnetic Field Design**: Independently developed a magnet box prototype using COMSOL and MATLAB Simulink, generating a $7\ \text{G}$ magnetic field with a $20\ \text{mG}/\text{cm}$ gradient over a $10\ \text{cm}$ range. The box, measuring approximately $18\ \text{cm}\times18\ \text{cm}\times33\ \text{cm}$, enhanced my expertise in FEA and involved leveraging concepts like magnetic scalar potential and image fields.

  - **Cryogenic and Vacuum Systems**: Contributed to system calibration and maintenance of a cryogenic system, gaining hands-on experience with vacuum technologies over five years.

  - **Ongoing Projects**: Machine learning algorithms for real-time magnetic field cancellation.
  
* **Graduate Teaching Assistant**  
  University of Kentucky, August 2017 - May 2019  
  - Instructed undergraduate students in Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, and physical optics through hands-on lab sessions and interactive recitations, fostering a deeper understanding of core physics concepts.
  - Assisted in preparing teaching materials, grading, and answering student inquiries during lab sessions.

* **Summer Research Assistant**  
  University of Kentucky, May 2018 - August 2018  
  - Conducted research on Etch Track-Directed Growth of Carbon Nanotubes on Graphite.
  - Utilized chemical vapor deposition techniques to create graphene/boron nitride samples.
  - Studied frictional properties on the surface of graphene using a microfluidic probe.
  
* **Grduation Project**
  Shenzhen University, September 2015 - May 2016
  - Research on the Control System of Intelligent Fish Tank Based on Single Chip Microcomputer

* **Open Laboratory Fund Project**
  Shenzhen University, September 2012 - October 2013
  - Research on the Design of Temperature-controlled Automatic Watering Device
