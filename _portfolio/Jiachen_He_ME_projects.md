## Abstract
This portfolio showcases my proficiency in Autodesk Inventor and mechanical engineering design, including 3D CAD models and detailed engineering drawings. Designed and simulated a compact modular Merritt coil system to replace Helmholtz coils, reducing the size by 6x while doubling the longitudinal field gradient and increasing the uniform field range by $33\%$. Over the years, I have devised and upgraded several instruments and devices suitable for various experimental applications in thermal control system and optical measurements. All of which are achieved through close collaboration with our departmental machine shop teams and engineers.
